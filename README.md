# Graphical models for stable processes
This repository contains the code for the publication "Graphical models for stable processes" by Florian Br√ºck, Sebastian Engelke and Stanislav Volgushev.
The code can be used to reproduce the simulation study as well as the data application. The experiments were distributed on a computing cluster and therefore full reproducibility cannot be ensured, which is why the datasets to produce the plots of the paper were included to be able to reproduce the plots of the paper.
